## Presentation
Give a 10 minute presentation on a bug/unique solution to a problem in GameDevelopment. For inspiration you can look for example at speedrunning or game post-mortems.

In the presentation:
-  Show the bug/feature (~2 min)
-  Explain what in the code caused said bug / Why this solution was chosen over other options
-  Give a solution to the bug / how this solution is implemented

The exact code is probably not available, so an approximation will do.

Examples of bugs:
-  The game speeding up in space invaders
-  Arbitrary code execution in Zelda/Pokemon, etc.
-  Skyrim Giants physics
-  Breaking through walls in Mario (out of bounds)
-  Teleporting up hills in Pikmin


Examples of solutions:
-  Running multiplayer in lockstep in AoE
-  Coyote time in Celeste
